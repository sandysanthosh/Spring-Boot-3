Spring Boot 3 introduces several new features and improvements over Spring Boot 2. Here are some key differences:

### 1. **Java Compatibility**
- **Spring Boot 2**: Compatible with Java 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12.
- **Spring Boot 3**: Requires Java 17 or higher. This is a significant shift, as it ensures the use of more modern Java features and improvements.

### 2. **Spring Framework**
- **Spring Boot 2**: Based on Spring Framework 5.x.
- **Spring Boot 3**: Built on Spring Framework 6, which includes support for Java 17 and features significant improvements and modernizations.

### 3. **GraalVM Native Image Support**
- **Spring Boot 2**: Limited support for GraalVM native images.
- **Spring Boot 3**: Enhanced support for building native images with GraalVM, allowing for faster startup times and reduced memory usage, which is particularly beneficial for cloud-native and microservices architectures.

### 4. **Jakarta EE 9**
- **Spring Boot 2**: Uses Java EE 8 APIs.
- **Spring Boot 3**: Migrates to Jakarta EE 9, which involves the namespace change from `javax.*` to `jakarta.*`. This migration is necessary for compatibility with future versions of Jakarta EE.

### 5. **Micrometer and Observability Improvements**
- **Spring Boot 2**: Introduced Micrometer for metrics and monitoring.
- **Spring Boot 3**: Further enhances observability features, including improvements in metrics, tracing, and logging, which are essential for modern applications.

### 6. **Kubernetes Support**
- **Spring Boot 2**: Basic support for deploying applications to Kubernetes.
- **Spring Boot 3**: Improved integration with Kubernetes, making it easier to develop, deploy, and manage Spring applications in a Kubernetes environment.

### 7. **Dependency Management**
- **Spring Boot 2**: Dependency management through Maven or Gradle.
- **Spring Boot 3**: Updated dependency management to reflect newer versions of libraries and frameworks, ensuring better compatibility and security.

### 8. **Configuration Improvements**
- **Spring Boot 2**: Configuration through `application.properties` or `application.yml`.
- **Spring Boot 3**: Continued improvements in configuration management, including enhanced support for configuration profiles and externalized configuration.

### 9. **Deprecated Features and Removals**
- **Spring Boot 2**: Contains some deprecated features that are still available.
- **Spring Boot 3**: Removal of deprecated features from Spring Boot 2, encouraging users to adopt newer, more efficient practices.

### 10. **Performance and Security**
- **Spring Boot 2**: Solid performance and security features.
- **Spring Boot 3**: Optimized for better performance and enhanced security, taking advantage of the latest Java features and improvements in the underlying frameworks.

### Conclusion
Spring Boot 3 represents a significant evolution of the framework, emphasizing modern Java features, improved performance, better observability, and enhanced support for cloud-native development. Upgrading from Spring Boot 2 to Spring Boot 3 will require some changes, especially due to the Jakarta EE namespace shift and the requirement for Java 17, but it brings many benefits in terms of functionality and performance.
